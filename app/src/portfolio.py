"""Portfolio Tracker: following the published trades of one trader.

Many traders publish their buys and sells as short texts -- in a newsletter,
a community, a channel ("I'm adding; 30 shares of AAPL at an average cost of
$190."). They are entered here by hand or pasted as a whole post, and this
module turns the journal into what one wants to know:
which positions are still open at what average cost, how they stand today,
and what the closed trades brought.

Rules of the bookkeeping:

  * Lots are matched first in, first out, as brokers do by default. Checked
    against a published portfolio: after partial sales the remaining lots
    matched it to the share.
  * A sell without a share count closes the whole position ("I'm closing my
    KO position at $62.40").
  * A trade without a price (posted without one, e.g. "QQQ closed") is
    valued at that day's close and marked as estimated, so the figure is
    there but is not mistaken for a posted one.
  * Selling more than is held only closes what is held; the rest is reported,
    not silently turned into a short position.
